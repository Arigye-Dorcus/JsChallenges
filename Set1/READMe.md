# Set 1 challenges in js
## challenge 1 
- You need to create a function called fizzBuzz that:
1. Takes two strings as input.
2. Adds up the total length of both strings.
3. Checks if that length is:
- Divisible by 3 → return "Fizz"
- Divisible by 5 → return "Buzz"
- Divisible by both 3 and 5 → return "FizzBuzz"
## challenge 2
1. Asks the user to enter their year of birth using prompt().
2. Calculates their age by subtracting the year of birth from the current year.
3. Based on the age:
- If age < 18 → print "You are a minor"
- If 18 ≤ age ≤ 36 → print "You are a youth"
- If age > 36 → print "You are an elder"
4. The result should be printed in the console using console.log().
## challenge 3
1. i am creating a function called twoSum that:
2. Takes two inputs:
- nums: an array of integers
- target: an integer
3. Finds two different numbers in the array that add up to the target.
4. Returns their indices as a pair (array) — like [index1, index2].
5. You are guaranteed that:
6. There is only one correct pair
7. You can’t use the same element twice
## challenge 4
1. This function identifies and returns the first palindromic string within an array of strings. 
2. Given an array of strings, this function returns the first palindromic string. 
3. If no palindrome is found, it returns an empty string.Option 
4. the firstPalindrome function takes an array of strings as input and searches for the first string that is a palindrome (reads the same forwards and backwards). 
5.  It returns the first palindrome found, or an empty string if none exist.
6. Returns the first palindromic string in an array of strings.
## challenge 5
1. Repeatedly sums the digits of an integer until a single-digit result is obtained.
