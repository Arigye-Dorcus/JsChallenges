# Set2 Challenges
## challenge 1
- The function processes the input array, filtering and sorting the elements into three categories: even numbers, odd numbers, and characters. Floats are included in the numeric categories based on their integer part. 
- The sorting is done without using the built-in sort method, requiring a manual sorting implementation (like insertion sort, selection sort, etc.).
## challenge 2
- Given an integer array nums, return true if any value appears at least twice in the array, and return false if every element is distinct.
## challenge 3
- Given an array nums of size n, return the majority element. The majority element is the element that appears more than ⌊n / 2⌋ times. You may assume that the majority element always exists in the array.
## challenge 4
- Given a non-empty array of integers nums, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one.
## challenge 5
- Write a function to fi nd the longest common prefi x string amongst an array of strings. If there is no common prefi x, return an empty string "".
